I summarized the workflow from multiple sources. Please see the "_[For more information](#for-more-information)_" section.

## Workflow

This is a workflow on how to create, merge and delete new branches.

> For the example the new branch is named: **branch-b**

> The text in the parenthesis are just comments **NOT** real commands.

**Create a new branch and push it to the remote repository**

```bash
git checkout -b branch-b
(do your work on "branch-b")
git status (see that you are in "branch-b")
git add .
git commit -m "updated component A"
git push --set-upstream origin branch-b (push the new branch to the remote repository, if needed)
```

❗❗ In all the next times you can to a normal push:

```bash
git push
```

**Merge & Push the new branch to master and delete it**

```bash
git merge master (still on branch branch-b)
(resolve any merge conflicts if there are any with git add, git commit)
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff branch-b (to log it in the commits)
git branch -d branch-b (this delete the branch on your local machine if you pushed the resolved merge conflicts or there was none)
git branch -D branch-b (if you didn't do the previous command because you didn't need to push the resolved merge conflicts, use this to force delete the branch)
git push
```

**Delete the remote branch on github**

There are two options:

1. [Using github interface](https://help.github.com/articles/deleting-and-restoring-branches-in-a-pull-request/)
2. With this command:
   ```bash
   git push origin :branch-b (after this you won't be able to restore the branch using github interface)
   ```

---

## Commands:

1. List of branches:

   *  Only remotes:
      ```bash
      git branch -r
      ```
   *  Local and remotes:
      ```bash
      git branch -a
      ```

2. Create a new branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b [NAME_OF_YOUR_NEW_BRANCH]
   ```

   This will create and move to the new branch.

3. When you want to push the new branch:

   ```bash
    git push --set-upstream origin [NAME_OF_YOUR_NEW_BRANCH]
   ```

4. Move between branches:

   To master

   ```bash
    git checkout master
   ```

   To exists branch

   ```bash
    git checkout [NAME_OF_YOUR_NEW_BRANCH]
   ```

5. Merge branch to the master:
   ```bash
    git checkout master
    git merge --no-ff branch-b
   ```
