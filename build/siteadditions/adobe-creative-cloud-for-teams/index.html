                <h1>Plans</h1>
                <p>Adobe offers two Creative Cloud for teams plans. The complete plan includes everything Creative Cloud has to offer—including all the latest CC desktop apps and exclusive features like 100GB of cloud storage and expert support. But if your work is specialized and you only need one CC product such as Photoshop CC or Illustrator CC, the single-app plan gives you access to one CC desktop app, along with 20GB of cloud storage, Behance ProSite, and access to Adobe Typekit.</p>
                <p>Both plans are managed through the easy-to-use web-based Admin Console, so administrators can easily add, track, and reassign seats across their organization—whether complete or single app—under one membership agreement and renew all seats on the same anniversary date.</p>

                    <div class="cc-accordion-content">
                        <p>Your Creative Cloud files are stored on your desktop as well as on the Creative Cloud servers. If you cancel or downgrade your paid membership, you will still have access to all of the files in the Creative Cloud folder on your computer and via the Creative Cloud website.</p>
                        <p>Your account will be downgraded to a free membership, which includes 2GB of storage. If you’re using more than 2GB of storage, you will not be able to upload any new files to the cloud until the amount of online space used in your account drops below your allotted amount.</p>
                        <p>If you are over your storage limit, you have 90 days to reduce your online usage or you may lose access to some or all of your files saved on the Creative Cloud servers.</p>

                    <div class="cc-accordion-content">
                        <p>No, you can save your files wherever you choose (on your local hard drive, mounted drives, thumb drives, and so on). However, your Creative Cloud membership comes with cloud storage that you can choose to take advantage of for backups, link sharing, folder collaboration, and more. The desktop application makes it easy to synchronize your local files with your Creative Cloud storage. So if you choose to sync your files to Creative Cloud, you’ll still retain a local copy of your files.</p>

                    <div class="cc-accordion-content">

                        <p>As an administrator, you will also be able to deploy Creative Cloud desktop applications independent of the cloud-based services using Creative Cloud Packager. Creative Cloud Packager is available through Creative Cloud for teams.

                <h1>Common Concerns</h1>
                <p>The following responses address common concerns about Creative Cloud for teams.</p>
                <h2>“We don't want to store private data in the cloud. The cloud just isn't for us.”</h2>
                <p>Using the 100GB of cloud storage is optional. You can manage data privacy with IT controls available in Creative Cloud for teams, network restrictions (firewall), and organizational policy. And you can block users on the corporate network from services like storage.</p>

                <h2>“We can't allow users to install software. We need to manage updates.”</h2>
                <p>Creative Cloud Packager enables you to centrally deploy all Creative Cloud desktop apps, or a customized subset, across your organization so you can maintain control of which Creative Cloud applications are installed. Updates can also be centrally managed. Centralized deployment ensures that everyone is on the same version of the software, which reduces support costs.</p>

                </span>
                <h2>“Launching Photoshop in the browser will drain our network bandwidth. Everyone has to download every update every time.”</h2>
                <p>Creative Cloud applications (like Photoshop CC) run on the desktop, not in a browser or thin client. The IT administrator downloads the apps from Creative Cloud once and centrally deploys them across the organization, or enables users to download and install on their own. Once installed, the apps run locally. You can centrally manage and install updates at your convenience through Creative Cloud Packager or enable users to install updates on their own. </p>
                <p>Centralized deployment prevents network congestion because you don’t have multiple users downloading the same bits at the same time. It also enables you to tailor Creative Cloud packages to meet the needs of your team.</p>
                <h2>“Creative Cloud will be more expensive over time.”</h2>
                <p>Perpetual licenses have a fixed value over time, whereas a Creative Cloud membership delivers access to new versions and features continuously, as they are developed. Not having access to the latest Adobe technology can also have its costs. With Creative Cloud membership, you don’t pay for upgrades or updates. And your organization gets the newest features as soon as they are available without having to wait for them to be bundled together in a traditional 12- to 24-month upgrade cycle.</p>

                <h2>“We want to own.”</h2>
                <p>You can continue to use your current Creative Suite perpetual licenses for as long as you like. But keep in mind that with Creative Cloud you pay for a membership and receive the latest Creative Cloud product versions along with continuous updates as they are developed. There is ongoing value with Creative Cloud, whereas the perpetual products were last updated in April 2012.</p>
